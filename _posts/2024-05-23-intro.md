The Workshop of Data-Intensive Systems for Machine Learning in 2024 is held in Arizona State University as part of the course CSE 598: Data Intensive Systems for Machine Learning.
The Workshop mainly targets students who were enrolled into the course. It requests for papers covering one or more of the following topics:

$\bullet$ Benchmark or performance comparison of machine learning systems or data-intensive systems.

$\bullet$ Improvement of the throughput or latency of end-to-end machine learning workflows.

$\bullet$ Co-optimization of data processing and machine learning processing.

$\bullet$ AI-enhanced data management systems.

$\bullet$ Improvement of other aspects of the machine learning systems or data-intensive systems, such as security, privacy, and so on.

$\bullet$ Model serving techniques: Model compression, adaptive batching techniques, and others.

$\bullet$ Systems enhancement for distributed or decentralized machine learning, including federated learning.
