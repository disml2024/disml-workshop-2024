The Workshop of Data-Intensive Systems for Machine Learning in 2024 is held in Arizona State University as part of the course CSE 598: Data Intensive Systems for Machine Learning, instructed by Professor [Jia Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/jiazou-web/home).
The Workshop mainly targets students who were enrolled into the course. It requests for papers covering one or more of the following topics:

- Benchmark or performance comparison of machine learning systems or data-intensive systems.

- Improvement of the throughput or latency of end-to-end machine learning workflows.

- Co-optimization of data processing and machine learning processing.

- AI-enhanced data management systems.

- Improvement of other aspects of the machine learning systems or data-intensive systems, such as security, privacy, and so on.

- Model serving techniques: Model compression, adaptive batching techniques, and others.

- Systems enhancement for distributed or decentralized machine learning, including federated learning.
