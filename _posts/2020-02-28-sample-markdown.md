In the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, selecting an efficient framework is crucial for optimizing resource usage and improving execution efficiency. This report aims to compare three popular machine learning frameworks—Velox, PyTorch, and TensorFlow—on their performance in a standard image classification task using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. We conducted a detailed evaluation of how Velox, PyTorch, and TensorFlow handled various machine learning workloads, including Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Embedding, focusing on their impact on execution time and memory usage. The findings from this comparison will guidedevelopers and businesses in choosing the most suitable framework for their specific needs, thusenhancing model performance while minimizing computational costs and resource utilization.
